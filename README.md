# HTML5 Practical 

This project shows basic HTML5 features in a simple sports club website.

- **index.html** — Home page with semantic layout, headings, quotes, time, abbreviation, and code examples.  
- **about.html** — Club background with sections, ordered/unordered lists, and definition list.  
- **media.html** — Page with images, responsive `<picture>`, audio, and video with captions.  
- **extras.html** — Tables with caption/thead/tbody/tfoot, plus `<details>`, `<dialog open>`, `<progress>`, and `<meter>`.  




### How to view locally
1. Download all files (HTML + assets folder).  
2. Double-click **index.html** to open in your browser.  
3. Use the navigation links to move between pages.
